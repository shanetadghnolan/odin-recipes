        <!-- Description of recipe -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Penne all’arrabbiata (penne in a garlic and chili tomato sauce) is typical of Roman cuisine, but known everywhere in Italy and even further afield. By now, it’s become famous enough to join the ranks of classic pasta dishes such as spaghetti cacio e pepe, pasta alla puttanesca, and pasta alla carbonara.</p>

        <!-- Ingredients of recipe -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>320g Penne Rigate Pasta</li>
            <li>1 Clove of Garlic</li>
            <li>380g of Peeled Tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 small Dried Chilli Peppers</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Fine Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps of recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by draining the peeled tomatoes. Transfer them to a bowl and crush them with a fork to break them up.</li>
            <li>Next, crumble the dried chili. Place a pot full of water, salted to taste, on the stove to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the peeled garlic clove.</li>
            <li>Now add the chili and fry it lightly over low heat, then add the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Stir it and add salt to taste. Cover the pan with a lid and let this sauce cook for around minutes, stirring every so often.</li>
            <li>When the sauce is nearly ready, put the pasta on to cook as well. Cook it al dente, following the cooking times stated on the packaging. Once minutes have passed, take the lid off the pan and remove the garlic.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and pour it directly into the sauce. Heat through for a minute, adding some of the cooking water if necessary, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped parsley, stir once more, and serve your penne <strong>all'arrabbiata</strong> while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
